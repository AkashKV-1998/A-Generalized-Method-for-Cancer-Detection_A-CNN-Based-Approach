## A brief idea about the project:

In our project, we have developed a web framework where doctors or patients can upload an image of a particular section of the body (a section can be an image of the skin or a CT scan of the lung or brain) and check whether this part contains any cancerous cell. The website takes an image as input and the user should choose a relevant deep learning model for cancer detection. Then the server takes this image and passes it to the model as per the user's choice. Finally model runs on the server side and after the model arrives at a result, this result will be then sent back to the website. So user can see the result on their screen.
