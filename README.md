## A brief idea about the project:

In our project, we have developed a web framework where doctors or patients can upload image of a particular area of body (area can be image of skin or CT scan of lung or brain) and check whether this part contain any cancerous cell. The website take an image as an input and user should choose a relevant deep learning model for cancer detection. Then the server take this image and pass it to the model as per the users choice. Finally model run in the server side and after model arrived at a result, this result will be then send back to website. So user can see the result at their screen.
